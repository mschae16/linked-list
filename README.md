# linked-list
Turing Front-end dev Linked-list project

This project consisted of creating several input fields that would potentially allow a user to build a list of bookmarked links, to be read at a later time. After a user inputs the website title and the web url, the user can click enter, and a bookmark will be generated.  Each bookmark also offers the ability to be marked as read, or removed completely from the list.  There is also a button to clear all read bookmarks. A counter at the top of the page keeps a tally on total bookmarks, as well as read and unread links.

The site is also fully responsive, and can be viewed on large screens, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. To aid in accessibility, aria labels have been added where appropriate.  The site is fully functional.
